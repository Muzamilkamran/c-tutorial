Object Oriented Programming in C++
Why oops?
c++ language was desinged with the of adding object-0riented features to c language.
As the size of programing increases,maintainability,readability and bug free nature
of programs decreases.
This was major problem with languages like c which relied upon function or procedures
(hence the name procedural programind language)
As  a result,the possibility   of not addresing the problem in an effective maner was high.
Also, as data was most neglected data security was easily promised.
Using a class solve the problem by modeling as a real world scenario.

procedures oriented programing 


consists of writting set of intructions for the computer to follow
main focus is on function not on folw of data.
function can either use local and global data.
Data move openly from function to function.

OBJECTED ORIENTED PROGRAMING
Work on the concept of class and objects
Treats data as critical element
Decomposes the program in object and bulid data and function around the objects

BASIC CONSPECTS IN OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING

CLASS--BASIC TEMPLE for creating objects.
OBject--basic run time enities.
Data Absrtuction &Encapsulation----wraping data and function into single unit.
Inheritance----propresties of the one class can be inheritan into other.
Polymorphism---Ability to take more than forms.
Dynamic Binding----Code which will excute is not known untill the program run.
Message Passing----Object message(information)  cal format.

BENEFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING 

Better code reusability use the object and inhertaanace.
Principle of data hiding help bulid secure systems.
Multiple objects can co.exit without interference.
